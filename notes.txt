Observations from running code through different approaches to the same result


console.log('Results for the extraLargeArray');
console.log("insert", resultsInsert.preciseWords);
console.log("append", resultsAppend.preciseWords);

Take note of the timing result for the extraLargeArray results– comparing when the extraLargeArray is passed to doublerAppend and doublerInsert.

Extra Credit:
THe slowest funtion is the insert method and it is lower because 
it requires moving each element after the inserted element(s) 
over by a count of 1. This becomes incredibly costly in terms 
of time-complexity as the larger the input the longer it will 
take to complete the action of shifting each and evey element 
in a larger array.
